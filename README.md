An intent to look for tactical insights through data analysis by comparing unit statistics

Step 1: Find relevant statistics and merge them into a clean csv
Step 2: Explore the data, and infer valuable observations
Step 3: Present the data visually

Notes:
----------
To develop an accurate model for initial exploratory data analysis, we want to find, ideally, official sources that explain the equation for combat engagements. From here we can deduce the required data points for analysis.

Damage Equation-Data needed:

To Hit; melee_attack, melee_defence, charge_bonus, bonus_vs_infantry, bonus_vs_large
To Damage; weapon base damage, weapon armour-piercing damage, armour (target), resistances(physical, missile, ward, fire, spell), attack interval
Other; hit_points, entity_count(num_men), bonus_hit_points, splash/cleave/collision, mass/radius/charge_speed
